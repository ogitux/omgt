## Open Manager for Game Tournaments ##

This is a web app (**PHP/MySQL**) for game tournament management, this app can be used with any kind of game from consoles and computers. You only need to have a web server running **PHP** and **MySQL** ;)

## Why OpenSource ##

Because there are many apps for gaming management that really sucks!! So, in my country Chile, many communities needs a tool for their tournaments.

## About Development ##
The new update is about a great change, actually we use [Kohana PHP](http://www.kohanaphp.com/) for our development, because it's a very easy and fast (like they say) framework for php.
